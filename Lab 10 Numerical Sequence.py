# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 10: Numeric Sequence
#
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      This program will prompt the user for a positive integer n and then 
#      display the nth FranÃ§ois number.
#
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      I couldn't set up an automated test case for the -1 and the 0 because  
#      they are considered invalid input and are caught in the function for 
#      getting a number from the user.
#
#      Once again, figuring out where I should be placing my asserts was a
#      a little challenging. I'm not entirely sure what is too much and what
#      makes sense to add an assert for.
#
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      45 minutes
